# UX Engineering at Microsoft AI Foundry

The AI Foundry UX Engineering (UXE) team brings design, engineering, and AI expertise together to accelerate the development of innovative products. 
We combine visual design, UI development, prototyping, and prompt engineering to help teams deliver high-quality, accessible, and performant user experiences.

Our work ranges from building reusable UI components and AI-powered tools to creating interactive prototypes and documenting best practices. 
We collaborate with engineers, designers, and product managers, focusing on practical problem-solving and enabling others to become more independent “Full Stack Builders.”

This repository contains our shared tooling, code, prototypes, and design system work in support of Microsoft AI Foundry projects. 
Explore our examples and resources for building, experimenting, and moving fast in an AI-driven environment.
